1st step: import data & adopt a particular architecture
=======================================================
With the script by Christophe Pallier (to be run on Neurospin workstations)
1) create manually a parameter file, saved as 'list_subjects.txt' (example provided in EXAMPLEpreproc_paramfile.m)
NB: the session to analyze must be labelled with the prefix epi_ . The reason is that functional files will have the form XXXepi_YYY.nii (with XXX the preprocessing prefixes and YYY the specific file name, whatever the length) and realignment parameters will have the form rp_aepi_YYY.txt; functional files will be matched with realignment files based on the YYY which is unique to a given session. Not using epi_ as a prefix in the import step will mess up the identification of this unique YYY tag in later steps.
2) run the command IN THE FOLDER WHERE DATA SHOULD BE IMPORTED:
# import_subjects_from_trio -a anat -f fMRI < list_subjects.txt
3) check that FieldMap for magnitude data has 'B0_1' in the file name; and that the phase data has 'B0_2' in the file name.

For physiological files:
The routine will need three files generated by the MRI (Mineapolis sequence): *Info.log, *RESP.log and *PULS.log for each fMRI session. 
The routine requires that the prefix * contains the name of the epi file (without the extension) that corresponds to this session. Pre-processed physiological files will have the name physio_regressors_*.txt
NB: the output files from the MRI have horrible names. Keep a note of these horrible names, one session at a time, during the MRI acquisition. After the acquisition, rename the files so that sess1, sess2, etc. appear in the filename. Then, fmspm12batch_RenameMove_PhysioFiles might help you to rename and move your files.

2nd step: preprocess data
=========================
With the help of the fmspm12batch
1) specify the parameter file (example provided in EXAMPLEpreproc_paramfile.m)
2) write and run SPM batches (and also Topup and retroicor), given this parameter file, with fmspm12batch_preproc('mypreprofile')
3) check the movement parameters with fmspm12batch_replotRealign
4) execute the fmspm12batch_preproc_newArchi to copy files into a new architecture.
5) to extract surface (currently not in a batch): 
	i) Normalize the extracted white & grey matter: Batch > Normalize Write
		> deformation: y
		> images: c1 & C2
		> resolution [1.5 1.5 1.5]
	ii) extract surface: Render > Extract Surface

NB: the routine retrieves most acquisition parameters (TR, slice timing ...) automatically, from the DICOM header. 

3rd step: first level analysis
==============================
1) specify the parameter file, modelname_paramfile.m
2) create the 'regressor script', modelname_multicond.m
3) create the 'contrast file', modelname_contrast.m (optional if you don't want to run contrasts)
4) run the analysis with fmspm12batch_1stlevel.m

4th step: 2nd level analysis
============================
1) specify the parameter file, modelname_paramfile.m
2) run the analysis with fmspm12batch_2ndlevel.m

BEWARE: CHECK THAT THESE ROUTINES ARE STILL VALID WITH SUBJECT NUMBER >9 (pb of 01 1 10 order...)
